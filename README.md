# TRENCHES EXCAVATOR

A crypto-archaeological wallet analysis tool with cyberpunk aesthetic for analyzing memecoin trading patterns across multiple blockchains.

## 🚀 Vision

TRENCHES EXCAVATOR is designed to "excavate" and visualize wallet trading data with an archaeological theme. The app reveals hidden patterns in memecoin trading through advanced visualizations and analytics.

## 🎯 Current Features

- **Archaeological UI Theme**: Dark earth tones with glowing amber accents
- **Wallet Address Validation**: Ethereum address format checking
- **Mock Data Display**: Portfolio metrics including P&L, token count, win rate
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Terminal-Style Interface**: Cyberpunk command-line aesthetic

## 🔮 Planned Features

### Core Analysis
- [ ] Multi-blockchain support (Solana, Ethereum, Base, etc.)
- [ ] Real-time portfolio tracking
- [ ] Trade history timeline
- [ ] Token holding analysis
- [ ] Connected wallet discovery
- [ ] Alpha token identification

### Advanced Visualizations
- [ ] **Worm Game Visualization**: Wallets grow/shrink based on trading performance
- [ ] Timeline scrubber for historical analysis
- [ ] Network graphs showing wallet connections
- [ ] Portfolio composition charts
- [ ] Profit distribution histograms

## 🛠️ Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Enter a test Ethereum address (e.g., `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`)
4. Watch the excavation process!

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The app uses a "crypto-archaeological" theme where:
- Wallets are "excavation sites"
- Trading data are "artifacts" to be discovered
- Profitable trades are "valuable finds"
- The interface resembles archaeological survey equipment

## 🔧 Next Development Steps

1. **API Integration**: Connect to blockchain data providers (Moralis, Alchemy)
2. **Real Data**: Replace mock data with actual wallet analysis
3. **Multi-chain Support**: Add Solana and other blockchain support
4. **Worm Visualization**: Implement the signature trading timeline viz
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Add pattern recognition and alpha discovery

## 🎮 Worm Game Concept

The signature feature will be a "worm game" style visualization where:
- Each wallet is represented as a growing/shrinking line
- Profitable trades make the wallet "grow"
- Losses make it "shrink"
- Timeline scrubber shows evolution from token launch to present
- Multiple wallets can be tracked simultaneously
